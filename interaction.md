# Smart KPI Engine - Interaction Design

## Core Interaction Framework

### 1. KPI Connection Matrix
- **Visual**: Interactive grid showing all KPIs across hospitals and departments
- **Interaction**: Click on any KPI to highlight its connections to other metrics
- **Response**: Shows relationship strength, correlation patterns, and impact pathways
- **Multi-turn**: Users can select multiple KPIs to create custom connection views

### 2. Hospital Performance Comparator
- **Visual**: Side-by-side dashboard comparing 3 hospitals
- **Interaction**: Toggle between different time periods and KPI categories
- **Response**: Real-time ranking changes, performance gaps highlighted
- **Multi-turn**: Drill down from hospital-level to department-level to individual KPI details

### 3. Smart Alert System
- **Visual**: Alert panel with color-coded priority levels
- **Interaction**: Click alerts to see root cause analysis and recommended actions
- **Response**: Shows interconnected impacts across departments
- **Multi-turn**: Users can acknowledge alerts, mark as resolved, or escalate

### 4. Trend Analysis Explorer
- **Visual**: Interactive time-series charts with correlation overlays
- **Interaction**: Select date ranges, add/remove KPIs from comparison
- **Response**: Shows trend patterns, seasonal variations, anomaly detection
- **Multi-turn**: Users can save custom views, export insights, set up monitoring

## Key Interactive Features

### KPI Relationship Mapping
- Hover over any metric to see its upstream and downstream impacts
- Visual flow diagrams showing how changes propagate through the system
- Impact scoring system showing which connections are strongest

### Real-time Scenario Modeling
- Adjust KPI values using sliders to see predicted impacts
- "What-if" analysis for resource allocation decisions
- Scenario comparison tools for strategic planning

### Collaborative Decision Tracking
- Tag team members in insights and decisions
- Track action items and their outcomes
- Historical decision impact analysis

## User Journey Flow
1. **Dashboard Overview**: Users see high-level connections and alerts
2. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Click through to explore specific relationships
3. **Scenario Planning**: Model changes and see predicted impacts
4. **Action Planning**: Create tasks and assign responsibilities
5. **Outcome Tracking**: Monitor results of implemented changes

## Data Interaction Patterns
- **Filtering**: By hospital, department, time period, KPI category
- **Sorting**: By performance, trend, impact level, urgency
- **Grouping**: Related KPIs, similar patterns, shared impacts
- **Drill-down**: Hospital → Department → Individual KPI → Root cause

## Responsive Design Considerations
- Mobile-first approach for on-the-go decision making
- Touch-friendly interactions for tablet use in meetings
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Accessibility features for all healthcare staff
